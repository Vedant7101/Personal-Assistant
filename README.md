## Personal Assistant

A personal voice assistant or intelligent personal assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on verbal
commands. Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants questions, control
home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks.

### Purpose

- Graphical user interfaces (GUI), objects, such as buttons, menus and documents, are presented for users to manipulate in ways that are similar to the way they are manipulated in the real work space, only that they are displayed on the screen as icons.
- The first and most essential step of interaction with GUI is target locating, sighted people can intuitively and the target object with a quick visual scan. But without visual access to the screen, this simple task is often very hard to finish, which is the main cause of difficulties in non-visual interaction.
- There is a need of Voice Command based application to control your phone. Also we notice that most of people use phone while driving bike/2 wheeler. This is very dangerous so people avoid this but remain with no other options.
